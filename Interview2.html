<h3>Please give a brief explanation about your field of work. 
</h3>
<p>Mr. Ahmed is a computer programmer/software developer who works for the Government of Canada. He is responsible for 
    creating computer software. Being a programmer, Mr. Ahmed explains that he is responsible for taking an algorithm and 
    encoding it into a notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer.</p>

<h3>What post-secondary programs are required in order to become a computer programmer? </h3>
<p>Mr. Ahmed explains that computer engineers, software engineers and computer scientists end up performing 
    very similar tasks once they are hired in a company or public sectors. So essentially, a lot of things that 
    software and computer engineers do (depending on the setting) are very similar to those who have a computer science 
    degree like him, like coding. Mr. Ahmed attended university in Oklahoma. He studied Computer Science for 4 years at 
    the Oklahoma State University. Mr. Ahmed mentioned that computer science is not the study of programming. Programming, 
    however, is an important part of what a computer scientist does. Programming is often the way that people create a 
    representation for our solutions. Therefore, this language representation and the process of creating it becomes a 
    fundamental part of the computer science discipline. He was able to discover that once he graduated and put his skills to use. 
    Computer science mainly combines the study of computation and information processing fundamentals with their application 
    in the world around us. As a computer scientist he was taught to build fast, reliable, scalable and secure software systems 
    to organize and analyze information. He was also taught how to use creative and innovative talents to conceive, design and 
    implement software systems. He was required to take grade 12 math course 
</p> 

<h3>What is your main role working as a computer programmer in the Government of Canada? What are some tasks that 
   you have to complete on a day-to-day basis?</h3>
<p>Being a computer programmer in the government of Canada, Mr. Ahmed is required to complete a 
    series of tasks. He uses pseudocode in his work for business applications (business software), 
    passport systems, statistics, proprietary software and document management where software is made for 
    organizing and managing multiple documents of various types. He uses languages such as SQL, c-sharp (C#) , 
    JavaScript, powerbuilder in order to complete his tasks. Mr. Ahmed goes on to explain that he uses SQL for managing 
    relational databases and performing various operations on the data in them. He also explains that C# or c-sharp can be 
    used for web development as well.</p>

<h3>In order for someone to work in the Government as a programmer, what skills do you think employers are looking for in 
    an applicant? </h3>
<p>Mr. Ahmed explains that one of the most important skills the government is looking for when hiring computer programmers 
 is experience and the ability to work well with others. “Collaboration is key! Not just in real life, but on the web as well. 
 Since we are constantly working with specialists from other department or even other cities around Canada. Being able to create 
 a smooth and easy to follow workflow for everyone is a skill that the government needs.” explains Mr. Ahmed. He also states that 
 as a Programmer / Analyst in the government of Canada, your role is to aid in the production, maintenance and enhancement of a 
 number of survey and administrative support applications, business software and passport systems as well as a range of other 
tasks as well. Programmer are expected to investigate and evaluate the cause of systems and data problems as well as recommend 
 solutions. So being able to have that skill and work proper work ethic to collaborate with others to find a solution is 
 especially important. He also states that he often has opportunities to perform detailed reviews and assess the operational 
 impact of changes to complex systems. In regards to programming language, Mr. Ahmed remembers that before being hired in the 
 government of Canada, it was required that candidates must possess a minimum of one (1) year of experience in software 
 development / programming using Java. Candidates must also possess: Experience in the analysis, design, integration, 
 programming, and testing of computer applications using a structured methodology. And finally, experience in application 
  development. Education wise, a person must have graduated with a degree from a recognized university or with a Technologist 
    diploma from a recognized college with specialization in Computer Science, Computer / Electrical / Electronic Engineering or 
   Network Security in order to be considered for a position as a programmer or analyst specialist in the government. 
</p>

<h3>Lastly, do you think programming and coding are an integral part of our society? If so, explain why. </h3>
<p> Mr. Ahmed explains that Programming is a process, with 3 very important phases: Problem Identification and Solving Phase, 
    Implementation Phase and Maintenance Phase. All three of them are important for computer programmers/software developers 
    to be able to solve problems. A lot of developers would equate the programming process with only algorithm implementation, 
    which is incorrect. Translating an algorithm into a programming language, which can then be compiled or interpreted and 
    finally understood by a computer, is only a part of the programming process. In my humble opinion, it is also the easiest 
    task.In short, Computer Programming is a process by which you solve a problem. In the modern world, with the amount of 
    problems and their complexity increasing many fold, it is a tool to get solutions by carefully, pushing the repetitive 
    tasks to the computer and thereby achieving “automation”, meanwhile still requiring input from programmers/software 
    developers. In short, it aids with interacting with machines and computers. To harness the power of computing in all human 
    endeavor. To automate tasks and finally to create intelligent machines,etc.</p>

<h2>Reflection </h2>
<p> After having some time to reflect on what Mr. Brar had to say about his field of work in computer engineering and his 
    job at Ford Motor Company, who has a vision for embracing the evolution of automotive as well as the mobility industry, 
    it was very interesting to see how the automotive industry is evolving to become more efficient and fit the needs of our 
    society today. With people like Mr. Brar who help program code for in-vehicle connectivity, meaning that he must write code 
    to ensure that an application in a car for example has access to wifi or cellular device, our vehicles are becoming more 
    efficient and advanced.
