        <h2>Introduction </h2> 
Ways of thinking, problem solving and creating in Computer Science have become invaluable parts of life and are important 
beyond ensuring that we have enough skilled workers. The broad view of computer science emphasises the range of
application which computing has in other fields. Computer Science as a discipline incorporates more than just coding, it
involves physical systems and networks, the collection, storage and analysis of data and the impact of computing on society!

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p> Computer Science is a discipline that serves society, its people and their needs in a multitude of ways. 
    As such equity, inclusion and diversity are critical factors in all aspects of Computer Science. 
    When setting up a software development team, for example, it is essential to understand the benefits of inclusion and 
    diversity and motivate students to actively seek out collaborators with different perspectives and backgrounds.
