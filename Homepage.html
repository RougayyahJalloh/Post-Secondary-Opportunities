        <h2>Introduction </h2> 
Today I was able to create my first blog. The purpose of this blog is to write about all the interesting things 
I've learnt and managed to do using things like 'html', 'processing', 'css' and many other amazing computer programming 
 languages. A couple weeks ago, I learned how to create a website about computer hardware using the html language. 
 At first, it was a little confusing to set up the website, but with the help of Khan Academy, 
  I was able to set up the basis of my website. <br><br>
