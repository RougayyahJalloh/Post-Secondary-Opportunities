        <h2>Introduction </h2> 
Today I was able to create my first blog. The purpose of this blog is to write<br> about all the interesting things 
 I've learnt and managed to do using things<br>like 'html', 'processing', 'css' and many other amazing computer programming 
 languages. A couple weeks ago, I learned how to create a website about computer hardware using the html language. 
 At first, it was <br> a little confusing to set up the website, but with the 
help of Khan Academy, I <br> was able to set up the basis of my website. <br><br>
