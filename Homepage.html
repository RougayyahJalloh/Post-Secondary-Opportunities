        <h1>Introduction </h1> 
Ways of thinking, problem solving and creating in Computer Science have become valuable parts of life and are important 
beyond ensuring that we have enough skilled workers. The broad view of computer science emphasises the range of
application which computing has in other fields. Computer Science as a discipline incorporates more than just coding, it
involves physical systems and networks, the collection, storage and analysis of data and the impact of computing on society. I have
           interviewed 2 professionals who work in different fields but use many aspects of computer science in their day-to-day tasks. 
           The first, Mr. Brar is a computer engineer and the second, Mr. Ahmed is a computer programmer. Visit the links provided 
            below to read more about how they use different coding languages in their work as well as what skills are important 
            for their career.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p> Computer Science is a discipline that serves society, its people and their needs in a multitude of ways. 
    As such equity, inclusion and diversity are critical factors in all aspects of Computer Science. 
    The most important aspect of computer science is problem solving, an essential skill for life. Students 
    study the design, development and analysis of software and hardware used to solve problems in a variety of business, 
    scientific and social contexts. Maybe a job involving computer science is out there waiting for you!
