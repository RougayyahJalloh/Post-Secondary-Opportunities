<em><h2>Karmindar Brar</h2></em> 


<h3>Please give a brief explanation about your field of work. 
</h3>
<p>Mr. Brar is a computer engineer who works for the Ford Motor Company, an American multinational automaker company 
  that manufactures passenger cars, trucks, and tractors as well as automotive parts and accessories. Being a computer 
    engineer, Mr. Brar field of work integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to 
    develop computer hardware and software.</p>

<h3>To become a computer engineer, what programs should be taken in post-secondary? </h3>
<p>In order to be a computer engineer, Mr. Brar explains that obtaining a bachelor’s degree from a university 
    (from the appropriate program) is required to become nearly any type of engineer and be able to practice in that 
    field, with a few exceptions with mechanical engineering. In order to become a computer engineer specifically, 
    there are three common options a person may select from to enter the field: a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering, 
    Computer Science or Software Engineering. Each of these programs take around 4 years to complete and require specific 
    prerequisite courses in grade 12 in order to be accepted. Mr. Brar has mentioned that he was required to take certain 
    courses in his 12th grade year when he attended A.Y Jackson Secondary School such as: English 4U or Français 4U, 
    Advanced Functions 4U, Calculus and Vectors 4U, Chemistry 4U and Physics 4U in order to be accepted into the computer 
    engineering program at UOttawa. </p>

<h3>During your four years at UOttawa in the Computer Engineering program, what aspects of computer software and hardware 
  design did your studies focus on?</h3>
<p>During his four years at the University of Ottawa studying to become a computer engineer, Mr. Brar explained that 
    he was able to build a solid foundation and understanding of traditional engineering and improve his skills. He also 
    states that because his program covers many different aspects of computer software and hardware design, it allowed for 
    my specialized studies in microprocessor-based systems (also called CPU for Central Processing Unit). A microprocessor 
    is the principal component of a computer, it executes a list of instructions, without any decision of its share. His 
    program also explored computer architecture, programming concepts, real-time operating systems, software engineering and 
    robotics. <br> <br> Mr. Brar also remembers taking courses like  ‘Discrete Mathematics for Computing’. This course draws 
    heavily on graph theory and mathematical logic. Included within theoretical computer science is the study of algorithms 
    for computing mathematical results which he states is essential for anyone working with algorithms. He also talks about 
    how mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete math, in particular combinatorics and 
    graph theory. This means that in order to learn the fundamental algorithms used by computer programmers, students like 
    him in computer engineering would need a solid background in subjects like discrete & continuous mathematics as 
    well as Introduction to Linear Algebra, which he took as a compulsory course in his first year.</p>


<h3>What is your main role working as a computer engineer in the Ford Motor Company? How are you able complete such tasks? </h3>
<p> Working in the Ford Motor Company as a computer engineer, Mr. Brar is constantly working and dealing with different types 
    of code, computer software and hardware design. The Ford Company that he is working for has a vision for embracing 
    the evolution of automotive as well as the mobility industry. This means that his company’s goal is to help customers 
    find smarter ways to move by enabling and empowering them with connectivity and data. He is able to complete his 
    tasks by working with fellow computer engineers and software engineers by experimentation, shape strategies and ideas 
    to launch innovative products. Mr. Brar specifically writes code for in-vehicle connectivity. This means that he must 
    write code to ensure that an application in a car for example has access to wifi or cellular device. In a programming 
    environment, he also collaborates with product managers, designers and product owners to develop solutions in the 
    mobility space. Using test-driven development, he helps build features for those solutions and deliver them using 
    continuous integration to get faster feedback. </p> 

<h3>In order to work at companies like the Ford Motor Company, what skills do you think employers are looking for in an applicant?</h3>
Mr. Brar mentions that upon being hired for this job, after working at Blackberry for the last decade, he was required to have 
        the following skills: 

<ul> 3+ years of work experience in Object Oriented development in at least one of the following web or mobile 
    technologies:<br><br> 

<li>Java / Ruby / Python / Golang OR… </li>
<li> Spring and/or Rails frameworks OR… </li> 
<li> Swift/Objective-C OR… </li> 
<li> Android / iOS </li> </ul>

He also needed to have excellent software engineering knowledge; OO Design Principles. Have practiced in 
        eXtreme Programming (XP) disciplines including paired programming and Test-first/Test Driven Development (TDD). 
        Have experience with Spring Cloud and deploying to cloud platforms, most importantly Pivotal Cloud Foundry or 
        Cloud Foundry. Have excellent collaboration skills since he would be working with other technical specialists, 
        Product Managers, UI/UX Designers, and product owners. Delivered products that include web front-end development; 
        JavaScript, client-side MVC frameworks like Angular, React, etc. Capable in Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery 
        tools and pipelines such as Jenkins, Maven, Gradle, etc. Lastly and most importantly, have a degree in Computer Science, 
        Engineering or similar technical discipline.

Finally, Mr. Brar talks about how when you’re write a program, you write it in pseudocode first in order to make sure it 
        makes sense. When I asked him what that meant, he went to explain that Pseudocode is a detailed ( informal high-level) 
        yet readable description of what a computer program or algorithm must do, expressed in a formally-styled natural 
        language rather than in a programming language. Pseudocode is sometimes used as a detailed step in the process of 
        developing a program. It is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. He says that when writing in 
        the language like c++, it can be easy for a person to get confused since we are human and coding can be lengthy and a 
        lot may be going on. Writing in pseudocode first will help you understand what you are writing first, almost like a 
        storyboard. 

<h3>Lastly, as someone who works with coding, software and hardware for a living, why do you think technology is an important 
    part of our society? Should more people know how to code? 
</h3>
Mr. Brar explained that computer engineering can be seen in our day to day lives and has a fast impact on or lifestyles and jobs. 
        How? He points out that some of the equipment that are in computer engineering are mobile phones, 
        digital video cameras and audio players, microwave ovens, aircrafts, security alarm systems and automobile, 
        things that are needed in people’s day-to-day lives. Most people today rely on computer engineering to 
        help enhance their lives. An example he stated, are business establishments, who are constantly perfecting their 
        products and services using computer engineering to deliver and meet the demands for their needs. They have very 
        high budgets for research and design, especially those in the electronic and engineering spots. 
        As a computer engineer, he is expected to always improve his computer engineering skill and keep up with 
        technological advancements so that scientists and researchers can predict the weather days ahead accurately, 
        predict possible natural disasters and access the extent of the damage before they even strike. Without software 
        and coding, programs that enable technological devices to function would not be able to work. Computer engineers 
        make and fix computers that run programs that keep everything on and in order. He believes that every student in 
        school should have a basic understanding of coding to help them understand the world around them. <br>

        <h2> Rougayyah's Reflection</h2>
After having some time to reflect on what Mr. Brar had to say about his field of work in computer engineering and 
        his job at Ford Motor Company, who has a vision for embracing the evolution of automotive as well as the mobility 
        industry, it was very interesting to see how the automotive industry is evolving to become more efficient and fit 
        the needs of our society today. With people like Mr. Brar who help program code for in-vehicle connectivity, 
        meaning that he must write code to ensure that an application in a car for example has access to wifi or cellular 
        device, our vehicles are becoming more efficient and advanced. <br><br>
