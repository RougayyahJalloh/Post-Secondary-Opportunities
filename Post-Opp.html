        <h2><em>Please give a brief explanation about your field of work?</em></h2>
        
     <p> Mr. Brar is a computer engineer who works for the Ford Motor Company, 
         an American multinational automaker company that manufactures passenger cars, 
         trucks, and tractors as well as automotive parts and accessories. Being a computer engineer, Mr. Brar's
         field of work integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required 
         to develop computer hardware and software. </p>  <hr> 

        

        <h2> <em> To become a computer engineer, what programs should be taken in post-secondary? </em></h2><br>
        
    In order to be a computer engineer, Mr. Brar explains that obtaining a bachelor’s degree from a university 
        (from the appropriate program) is required to become nearly any type of engineer and be able to practice in 
        that field, with a few exceptions with mechanical engineering. In order to become a computer engineer 
        specifically, there are three common options a person may select from to enter the field: a Bachelor's Degree 
        in Computer Engineering, Computer Science or Software Engineering. Each of these programs take around 4 years to 
        complete and require specific prerequisite courses in grade 12 in order to be accepted. Mr. Brar has mentioned 
        that he was required to take certain courses in his 12th grade year when he attended A.Y Jackson Secondary School 
        such as: English 4U or Français 4U, Advanced Functions 4U, Calculus and Vectors 4U, Chemistry 4U and Physics 4U in 
        order to be accepted into the computer engineering program at UOttawa. <hr> 


        <h2> <em>During your four years at UOttawa in the Computer Engineering program, 
            what aspects of computer software and hardware design did your studies focus on?  </em> </h2> 
        During his four years at the University of Ottawa studying to become a computer engineer, Mr. Brar 
        explained that he was able to build a solid foundation and understanding of traditional engineering and 
        improve his skills. He also states that because his program covers many different aspects of computer software 
        and hardware design, it allowed for my specialized studies in microprocessor-based systems 
        (also called CPU for Central Processing Unit). A microprocessor is the principal component of a computer, 
        it executes a list of instructions, without any decision of its share. His program also explored computer 
        architecture, programming concepts, real-time operating systems, software engineering and robotics. Mr. Brar 
        also remembers taking courses like  ‘Discrete Mathematics for Computing’. This course draws heavily on graph theory 
        and mathematical logic. Included within theoretical computer science is the study of algorithms for computing 
        mathematical results which he states is essential for anyone working with algorithms. He also talks about how 
        mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete math, in particular combinatorics 
        and graph theory. This means that in order to learn the fundamental algorithms used by computer programmers, 
        students like him in computer engineering would need a solid background in subjects like discrete & continuous 
        mathematics as well as Introduction to Linear Algebra, which he took as a compulsory course in his first year.<hr>

          <h2> <em>What is your main role working as a computer engineer in the Ford Motor Company? 
              How are you able complete such tasks? </em> </h2>
    Working in the Ford Motor Company as a computer engineer, Mr. Brar is constantly working and dealing 
        with different types of code, computer software and hardware design. The Ford Company that he is 
        working for has a vision for embracing the evolution of automotive as well as the mobility industry. 
        This means that his company’s goal is to help customers find smarter ways to move by enabling and empowering 
        them with connectivity and data. He is able to complete his tasks by working with fellow computer engineers 
        and software engineers by experimentation, shape strategies and ideas to launch innovative products. Mr. Brar 
        specifically writes code for in-vehicle connectivity. This means that he must write code to ensure that an 
        application in a car for example has access to wifi or cellular device. In a programming environment, he also 
        collaborates with product managers, designers and product owners to develop solutions in the mobility space. 
        Using test-driven development, he helps build features for those solutions and deliver them using continuous 
        integration to get faster feedback. <hr>
